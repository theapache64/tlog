#  📖 tlog
> tech blog of the day

**tlog**, derived from "tech blog", is a simple website that redirects you to a different tech blog every day. 
It is a project that I created to encourage myself to read a tech blog daily 🫠

## 💡 Usage
Just visit https://theapache64.github.io/tlog 

## ➕ Got a blog to share?
If you want to add your blog to the list, please submit this form ➡️ https://forms.gle/V1Vj8dsw5xps1nJe7

## 📆 Schedule
You can see the full schedule here ➡️ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pvwjyRWvRPzHoacraKi4w6324-BErl3Bs-Q9HIwbeGI/edit?usp=sharing

## ⌨️ ProTip

If you're a Raycast user, add a "quick link" to `tlog` so that you can quickly read the blog of the day whenever you're bored ;)
